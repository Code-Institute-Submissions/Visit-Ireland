# Visit-Ireland

### Introduction
This Website was built for the fictional client Visit-Ireland. The purpose of this website was to help promote the country of Ireland and help to guide tourists on places to see.
The goal was to make a  website where visitors can see popular tourists sites to visit, help tourists to find places to stay, eat and drink at ease.
Also to contact the website for more info by email or social media links. You can view the full site here hosted on [Github](https://waynecrawley.github.io/Visit-Ireland/).

## UX
The website was built with a mobile first approach. The client wanted a single page website that was interactive and easy to navigate.
### User Stories

**So that**  it's easy for me to decide on a venue.  

**As a** Returning Visitor  
**I want** to be able to contact the company easily

### Strategy
 + This project is for the creation of a website for Visit Ireland to help promote the country of ireland, that is visually pleasing and has an ease of use.

### Scope
+ The website should be responsive, contain interactive elements, work on all devices and browsers. The website must consist of tourist sites to visit, help to find places to stay, eat and sleep, a contact form and social media links.
### Structure
+ The overall structure of the website was that of a single page website, with three main sections. places to discover, search places to stay, eat and sleep and a contact us section. 
### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

### Surface

+ A Mostly black and white colour theme was used for this website, which showcases the classic professional look. A pop of colour was added through the use of colour images and touch of green on link backgrounds.

## Testing
+ The first thing I did was , worked through my user stories to make sure my website reached all the requirements of my user stories, before moving on to the more technical testing.
+ I ran the HTML for all pages through [W3C HTML Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) by direct input. - **Working as intended**
+ I ran the CSS through [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://www.css-validator.org/) by direct input. - **Working as intended**
+ i used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to test my javascript for errors.
+ All links tested manually - **Working as intended**
+ All buttons tested manually - **Working as intended**
+ Tested different screen sizes using Google Developer Tools.
  * Pixel 2 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 6 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 7 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 8 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone X - **Working as intended**
  * iPad - **Working as intended**
  * iPad Pro  - **Working as intended**
  * Laptop with HiDPI screen - **See Known Bugs**

+ I got friends to test out the live site on Github and give me Feedback on any issues. - **See Known Bugs**
+ I used my Huwawei P20 Android Phone to test website - **Working as intended**
+ I posted my webpage for peer review and made changes based on feedback
  * Added background colour change on active buttons in search places for google maps.
  * Added smoothscroll to the links in Navbar.
+ The website was tested on different browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

### Issues fixed 
+ **JavaScript Carousel** Skips 0 index in array, so we were missing a image on page load, but we loaded that image up on index.html
+ **GooglemapsApi** I had an issue on page load, when the user clicked one of  search button Icons it loaded all the place types. This was fixed setting the variable type to restraunt on page laod and setting the button to show its active.
+ **EmailJS** I had an issue of the form not clearing after submission. This is eventually fixed by finding the reset Method on W3 Schools.
### Known Bugs
+ On Desktop view, theirs to much whitespace between the Shamrock image and the div below.
+ Googlemaps only loads 80% of the time when page loads for the first time.
